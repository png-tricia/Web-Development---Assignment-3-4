## SYST10049 Web Development - Assignment 3 and 4 
Program: **Computer Programming @ Sheridan College** <br>
Note: The following assignment was completed during Semester 1 (2023) <br>
Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## The Task:
In this assignment, we were required to develop an e-commerce site, which was an online bookstore. Through the developed site, the user should be able to login, search for books and view book details.

## Details: 
1. **Home**: This is the front page of the site. For this page, the user should specify whether he/she is a customer or not. If a customer, a customer login, and password are required to be passed for this page. If not a customer, there should be a registration page available to sign up. After login, either way the returned HTML document should display the search request page. Use JavaScript to validate the required fields in the log in and register page.
2. **Search Request**: This page should allow the user to enter a search criterion (search by name, by author, by topic) and a value in a form.
3. **Search Result**: The reply to the search request should be provided by a search result page, (this could be a pretend search result). The HTML document returned should contain links to Search Request and Product Detail.
4. **Product Detail**: This web page returns the details of a particular book. If the customer selects a book, the details of the book should be displayed. The HTML document returned should contain links to Search Request and Home Page.

## Thoughts/Comments: 
Of course the final assignment had to be the most difficult one. I recall the class making a commotion because we weren't supposed to be learning JavaScript during Sem 1, none of the other sections were. We did have course materials to help with the customer validation but the whole search engine and results page, we had to learn on our own. Another big shoutout to w3schools, you have saved me again and again. <br>
Reminder: the following folders - Create Account, Search, SearchAuthor, SearchDate, SearchTitle are missing their respective images folder.
